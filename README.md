# Valheim dedicated server lag reduction

## Description
With this server modification, everything will load much faster
On my server we had the problem, if you were away from a large base for a while or logged into the server, that it could take up to 30 seconds or more until you could open doors or box contents were displayed or until the terrain has loaded properly. With this server modification, the problem will be eliminated.
This modification increases the data transfer rate from client to server and server to client 

## How to install
Download the file assembly_valheim.dll from [here](https://github.com/Fr1tzl1/Valheim_dedicated_server_lag_reduction/releases) and replace it in the folder SERVER_INSTALL_PATH/serverfiles/valheim_server_Data/Managed/
